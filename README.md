# A Bit About Mself
Im Aman V.Shafeeq from CSE-D S1. Im from Kadavanthara, Ernakulam. Im very much into solving problems and riddles, so Ive come to like the idea of Competitive Programming. I also draw, animate(2d hand drawn), play chess, tennis, football and I LOVE Physics, I would read a ton of articles but not much these days cuz its cosumes too much time.
# WHATS YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS
I wanna participate in a bunch Competitive coding and lay a foundation in other important programming languages at the same time strengthening my logic.
# HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB
Obviously i will do what the club requires of me if I were a membor. Give my best to the club whether its projects or events.
#HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS?
The tasks where lengthy but we were not left clueless as to what we were supposed to do. I got to learn a lot throughout the process and an approximate idea as to where I stand.
