#Discord Bot
This task was rather fun. It was very confusing at first but gradually go ta hang of it. Web scraping was easy once i found out about inspect and css selecter(I was using <h1>, <p>, etc.. to get the data). Had to learn what intents were on the discord.py file and after the syntaxes were done it was more of a "play-with-the-code-until-you-get-it-right" moment.
