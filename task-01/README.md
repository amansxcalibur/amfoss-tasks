#Terminal WIzard
Since it was the first time i was dealing with terminal commands, this task was surely not in my comfort zone. I feel like this was a great intro to the tasksets cuz it honts the nature of the upcoming tasks-ull have to do knowledge hunting a LOT.
The codes ive used:
cd:for rnavigating through the folders
nano:for edting text files
mkdir:to make a directory
ls:to view all files inside the folder
rm:to remove files
git checkout:to switch to diff branches
git status
git push:push to the repository
git commit
cat:to view the text files
git init: to initialize the repository
git clone: cloning a github repository
