# Euler
Euler01 test cases 2 and 3 where wrong, i had previously ran into the wrong answer error because i forgot to subtract the overlapping multiples of both 3 and 5,ie 15
Euler02 all test cases succesful. It was a pretty straightforward problem, all i had to do was store the larger number of the fibonacci pairs and make sure it didnt exceed the limit(the user input)
Euler03 test cases 3 and 4 exceeded time limit. Dont have time to optimize it sadly, especially cuz I like solving problems like these.
