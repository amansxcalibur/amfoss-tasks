This website was built using HUGO!

Hugo is an open-source static site generator built with Golang that basically carried me all the way through.

Hugo itself is a static site generator built with Go (also known as Golang). It gracefully takes content files and templates to orchestrate the birth of a complete website.

I went to the terminal to install Hugo, for which I used the statement : ```brew install hugo```

I wanted to get a fancy theme but sadly Papermod and other more simplistic ones where what worked. 

Cloned the theme and use dthe statement : hugo new site hugo-demo

To run the website, I used the command : hugo server

This created a local host within my computer. Then I opened it on chrome. Was a tear-jerking moment. Added the contents and some tidying up...voila
