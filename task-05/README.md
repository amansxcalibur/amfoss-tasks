# HTML
This task was rather confusing cuz I havent completely grasped the concepts of css which had me running in loops wondering why the boxes dont move. Im aware that my code isnt clean and is not that user friendly too, i guess(???). I didnt have much trouble with the html part, but then again the html and the css part should be working together to get the desired result.
